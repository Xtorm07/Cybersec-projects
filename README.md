# ❗️Flyscanner❗️
This is a Lightweight option of a simple but fast port scanner written in python it can be use to scan network addresses and ranges specifying the ports you want to scan. Flyscanner is built with threads to make the scan faster but also you can specify the amounts of threads to use so you don't make to much noise.
Very useful to run in environtments where you dont have nmap installed but you have python (very common)

!!requirements are not needed!!
